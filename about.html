                <div class="wrapper">
                    <p class="text">Model United Nations (MUN) is an educational simulation of the United Nations where students take on the roles of diplomats representing different countries or entities and attempt to solve specific problems in accordance with their country's/entity's policies and perspective. It provides a platform for participants to engage in diplomacy, research, and debate global issues. Through MUN, students gain a deeper understanding of international relations, develop critical thinking and negotiation skills, and learn to collaborate with others in finding solutions to complex problems.</p>
                    <p class="text">At a MUN conference you will find <a href="./glsmun-2024.html#committees-link">several committees</a>  that mirror the different UN bodies, such as the Security Council or the Economic and Social Council, as well as committees taking place in alternate realities or in the past and specialized agencies, such as the Future Security Council, the Historical Security Council, or the World Trade Organisation. As a delegate/representative your task will be to discuss the issue of your committee, propose viable solutions, and cooperate with the rest of your committee to write a resolution that best tackles the problem at hand simultaneously being a good compromise between all the contributors to the document.</p>

                <div class="wrapper">
                    <p class="text">MUN conferences offer a unique learning experience where you will be given the ability to develop a wide range of skills. You will learn the art of public speaking, as you deliver speeches in the General Assembly and committee sessions. You will greatly improve your research skills as you delve into complex topics, gather relevant information, and formulate arguments based on your country's/entity's position. You will hone your cooperation, critical thinking, and negotiation skills as you attempt to come up with a solution that satisfies all parties and write a resolution to fully address the issue. Additionally, for those looking to get into a high-ranking college, many universities look favorably upon applicants who attend and excel at MUNs. </p>

                    <p class="text">An often understated part of MUN conferences are the amazing people you will meet there and the networking opportunities you will be given, GLSMUN 2024 brings together the brightest youth from all over Poland and abroad to compete, work together and most importantly have lots of fun. One reason to attend our conference specifically (besides the fact that it's the best in every way, shape, and form) are our exclusive committees which you will not encounter at other conferences, such as the Global Leaders' Summit.
